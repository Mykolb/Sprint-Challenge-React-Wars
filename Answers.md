1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React is a UI built by Facebook that does one thing really well and that is rendering UI. It slowly loads what is being rendered to the page instead of updating the data all at once. React is about breaking the pages down into tiny pieces called components. Everything in React is a component. Instead of having to update an entire page for one change, you only have to update the one component and the rest of the page stays the same. React breaks code into maintainable, manageable, reusable piece of code.
